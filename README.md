<h1>Steroids Target Trial Emulation Tutorial</h1>

This repository was created to help other analysts run an analysis similar to Hoffman et. al's *Corticosteroids in COVID-19: Optimizing Observational Research Through Target Trial Emulations* (2022).

Currently, the tutorial contains:

- Code to run a similar analysis with demo data of n=2000 patients: [`analysis.R`](code/analysis.R).

- Code to clean the output of `analysis.R`: [`report_results.R`](code/report_results.R)

- A slideshow summary of the paper: [hoffman_acic_slides.pdf](presentations/hoffman_acic_slides.pdf). These slides were presented at the American Causal Inference Conference in Berkeley, CA on May 24, 2022.
